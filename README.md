App I made for my graduation project.

This app I made as my graduation project. The goals were building an app with the swift language that uses geolocation and connects to a parse backend.

The app lets you create stores and products for the stores. It also lets you put items you're looking for in a wishing list. Selecting an item leads you to a map where it shows the nearby stores that sells the product. Choosing a store lets you check out the details of products that match your search.
